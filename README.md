# Propositional-logic-expression-analysis
This C++ program performs logical formula analysis and 
truth table generation for a given propositional logic expression. 

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what it does:

Given a logical formula (in infix notation), the program:

Parses and converts it to postfix notation.

Evaluates it for all truth assignments.

Computes statistics about the formula 
(number of subformulas, operators, distinct variables and 
number of appearences for each variable).

Generates the full truth table.
